<h3>1. Meiazhagan</h3>
<p>It's kind of my first movie which made me say "This is Feel-good". <br/>I really Loved this movie</p>
<h3>2. 8 Vasanthalu</h3>
<p>This was a movie I randomly got to know about. This movie pictured<br/>"Feminism" really well. I loved the visuals. It was just good.</p>
<h3>3. Bison</h3>
<p>This was the recent movie I watched. Dhruv Vikram's acting was really good.<br/>He shutted all the haters with his acting. I loved the moral they concluded with this movie.<br/>I got to learn about some things  I didn't think it would be serious</p>
